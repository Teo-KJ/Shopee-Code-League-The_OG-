### Background
At Shopee, we always strive to ensure the customer’s highest satisfaction. Whatever product is sold on Shopee, we ensure the best user experience starting from product searching to product delivery, including product packaging, and product quality. Once a product is delivered, we always encourage our customer to rate the product and write their overall experience on the product landing page.

The rating and comments provided for a product by our buyers are most important to us. These product reviews help us to understand our customers needs and quickly adapt our services to provide a much better experience for our customers for the next order. The user's comments for a product ranges from aspects including delivery services, product packaging, product quality, product specifications, payment method, etc. Therefore it is important for us to build an accurate system to understand these reviews which has a great impact on overall Shopee’s user experience. This system is termed: "Shopee Product Review Sentiment Analyser". 

### Task
In this competition, a multiple product review sentiment classification model needs to be built. There are ~150k product reviews from different categories, including electronics, furniture, home & living products like air-conditioner and fashion products like T-shirts, rings, etc. For data security purposes, the review ids will be desensitized. The evaluation metrics is top-1 accuracy.

### Background Information
The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee.

Sending emails is one of the marketing channels Shopee uses to reach out to our users. Being able to predict whether a user opens an email allows Shopee to forecast and evaluate the performance of future marketing campaigns before launch. This is because when a user opens an email, the probability of the user knowing the campaign increases and this in turn increases the probability of the user making a checkout during the campaign period. Therefore, with the predicted open rates, Shopee can better develop, strategize and implement future marketing campaigns.

### Task
We provide you with data related to marketing emails (Electronic Direct Mail) that were sent to Shopee users over a certain period. It contains information about
* User-specific information
* Email nature
* Users’ engagement on the platform
* User’s reaction to the email, including whether users opened the email

Based on the data provided, you must predict whether each user will open an email sent to him/her.
